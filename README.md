# HW6: Brainstorming assignment (1.0 pts)

During the next class we will be choosing groups for the initial AI project efforts. You are ultimately responsible for developing the project ideas you will choose among, which makes brainstorming necessary. The instructor will facilitate project selection. Everyone, **individually** , should write a short paragraph or few sentences describing a potential project idea. Ideally you are looking for something that fits within a 1-month timeframe in a class for groups of size 4-5. The point of this is mainly to have everyone, independently, consider ideas so that when we come together for project selection we can pick among the best. Note, projects will require at least 4 people to agree to do them, so you may need to "sell" your idea on project selection day - making it even more important to flesh out your idea with a short paragraph of writing.

For this assignment, you are to individually submit your project paragraph **in this document in the appropriate area.** Also organize this information for yourself so you are ready to discuss your choices and ideas on the appropriate days in class where groups are chosen. Note: Brainstorming work is to be done **individually**. The goal is to generate ideas and have the best ideas selected. We will choose groups in class on the proper day based on these ideas. Note: students in the class are required to utilize at least two of the three options: 1) commercial cloud tools, 2) jupyter notebooks with python, and 3) mobile/client-side integration in the two projects undertaken in this course.

Insert your project idea here, Use the same format as for Project 1.


# HW7: Project proposal (4 pts)

The goal of this assignment is to bring your group together and plan for your project effort for maximum impact. Many projects lead to portfolio items and published papers, so be aware of the potential for your efforts not only in learning but demonstrating what you have learned. Note that 2 points will be awarded for group work and the other 2 points will be awarded for attending **and** satisfactorily answering questions on the two official group meetings for this course.

**Submit:**

1. Within 1 week after topic selection in class - your group membership **must be reflected on the list in this document (which is currently set to suggestion/comment access).**
2. Link a publicly-accessible PDF of your topic proposal in the project list of this document at the appropriate location. Note, effort on the proposal will benefit composing the final report.

**Selecting your project.** Group selection and topic choice will be facilitated in class, but you are ultimately responsible for selecting an appropriate project, joining a group, indicating your group memberships, and submitting a proposal with all names on the proposal.

**Groups:**** Groups must be 4-5 people - **** no individuals**. All people do not need to be involved in all aspects of the project but all are REQUIRED to participate substantially in the combined project efforts. You are free to change the project plan based on the info available or interests of the group, but you are to clear it with the instructor before you do.

Although we encourage you to work with other people, we recognize that it is not always practicable to seek new partners for Project 2. However, **we will strictly enforce the rule that your topic in Project 2 must be different from your topic in Project 1.**

**Topic selection:** This is a course about software development in AI. The goal is to introduce you to the wide variety of APIs, frameworks, and resources available. Choose wisely. You are free to change your minds (even after the proposal) but you must discuss with the instructor if you do. You can do a straightforward project (e.g. predict X with maximum accuracy given data Y) or pursue more exploratory projects.

**Required topic selection:** You are required to use two of the following approaches in the two projects (i.e., the approaches used must be different for the two projects)

1. **Cloud tools:** Running from instances in one of the top three commercial cloud platforms (Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform) and utilizing at least one AI-oriented API on the platform
2. **Jupyter notebooks:** Using a Jupyter notebook locally with Python with sklearn and/or Tensorflow/Keras (use the Anaconda installation if unsure) and utilizing a cloud-based equivalent as well (Google Colaboratory, Kaggle Kernel, Google Datalab).
3. **Mobile/client-side integration:** Integrating a mobile or client-side web tool for data input AND automated application of a trained model. Android, iOS, web dev stackâ€¦ Model training is preferred, but application of a previously trained model is acceptable.

**Data:** There needs to be an available data set for you to analyze. Ideally larger and more complex data than something in a curated row-column or database table format (though simpler data sets may be better for initial projects if you are unsure of your abilities)

**Learning goal:** What is the goal of unsupervised or supervised learning on this data? Is it possible with the data available?

**Exploratory and Extensible:** Projects should have multiple facets. One concrete prediction objective is good, but there needs to be enough depth to your approach or optional goals that it cannot be done in only a few days.

**Turning in:** Make sure everyone in your team approves of the proposal. Then link a publicly-accessible PDF of your topic proposal in the project list of this document at the appropriate location. Only one person in the group needs to submit.


# HW8: Project Update (2 pts, two parts)

The goal of the project update is to record a short video describing what you have accomplished already and what you plan to do in sufficient detail given the time constraint. An incremental update to any starting tutorials should have been completed. Most importantly, at this stage everyone in your group should have an awareness of how they can specifically contribute, with no significant bottlenecks. There are two parts to turn in for this update, both minor efforts if your project is unfolding well. One for your group to accomplish and one for each of you individually

**A) Record an MP4 video describing your progress aimed at your fellow students (1 pt - per group)**

Your completed project presentations in this class are to be recorded videos with slides and a run of your project code as appropriate. This task is a warm-up in terms of tools you will use. Record a brief 2-4 minute video as a status update aimed at your fellow students in the class. Powerpoint enables audio recordings for slides that can be converted automatically into videos. You can also record a zoom session presenting a set of slides. There is no need to see anyone in the video and all videos should have narrations from someone in the group throughout (no using other people's videos, or just showing with text). This is also an opportunity to request very specific help/advice from your classmates. This is one tool people will rely on for their individual consultations (see below).

When finished with your video, place it in the cloud storage of your choice and create a link that is publicly-viewable (again, be sure to check this permission is set). Then update the indicated link location on the project list with that link. Remember to narrate this toward your fellow students rather than the instructor (who is already meeting with most groups weekly anyway). Think about what they might find useful, or provide details that they could give you constructive feedback from.

**B) Individual consultations (1 pt - per individual)**

The previous part is to be on a per-group basis, while this part is to be done individually. Based on the linked project proposals and the project update videos each person should be able to have a rough understanding of other projects in the class. Pick one project you would like to learn more about or think you could help out. Each person in your group is expected to pick a different project to consult (get to know your classmates!). Your goal is not to evaluate their project, but rather to find out what you can learn from their efforts, or how you can help them. This can be done in person, by email, or phone... but it must be more than simply reviewing their proposal without contacting the group. Try to be proactive and contact a group early on, but you can also attend the Saturday sessions and provide your feedback then.

Write a short paragraph about your efforts and paste that short paragraph in the appropriate list in the P1 assignment with your name and date as shown. Focus on what you learned and advice/effort you may have contributed rather than feelings or opinions. Feel free to copy/paste from contact emails if so desired.


# HW9: Project Report (12 pts)

Your report is to provide a summary of what you have accomplished, without assuming any prior knowledge of your project. This should resemble your proposal in structure, but with your accomplishments rather than plans clearly documented. In practice, a project report is meant to be read by stakeholders before an oral presentation is made. As such the report should contain details that are not normally covered in an oral presentation. **You must submit the report through Canvas.** A submission link has been provided for this. **Project title** and **names** of all people involved in the project. Please highlight any substantial effort or help you received. **Note: out of the 12 points available, 6 points will be awarded on the basis of group work and the other 6 points will be awarded on the basis of code commits made to the GitHub repository for the group that you work with.**

For the **report structure** consult the **Project Report Requirements.docx** in Canvas. In addition to the requirements listed out in this document, the following two items also need to be supplied.

**Repository / Archive:** Provide a repository link, ideally, or otherwise archived version of your project with documentation appropriate for another person to independently be able to quickly set up your environment.

**Code: Provide a PDF of all of the code** that has been written by your group, and include it in the report as an appendix. Singly-spaced 10pt font is preferred. Don't include auto-generated code. Use common sense.


**HW10: Project Presentation (11 pts)**

Your presentation is a summary of what you have accomplished, motivated by the goals and intended learning in this pursuit, and predicated on informing about the tools and techniques you have used - emphasizing both the machine learning aspects as well as the software design approaches. Your grade will reflect more on what you communicate than on the style. Additionally, you can consider your presentations an advertisement to others in case they may want to continue where you left off. Out of the 11 points available for this assessment 8 points will be awarded according to the group contribution and the other 3 points will be awarded on the basis of individual contribution made during the live presentation by the team member.

Turn into Canvas the following:

1. A conveniently viewable copy of your slides **in PDF form** with a publicly-accessible link next to your group in the appropriate location
2. Next to your program group in this document link to a recorded **mp4** demonstrating your project with these slides as a portion of your presentation. **Recorded presentations must be between 4 and 8 minutes. Penalties will apply if they are outside this time range.**

**Notes on presentation structure: Consult the Project Presentation Requirements.docx document in Canvas.**

Live Demonstration on Saturday 3 December from 2.30 pm onwards in the usual classroom. This will involve each member of the group doing a walkthrough of the design strategy and the code. This part of the assessment will assess your individual contribution to the project and attendance will be **mandatory** at this session.
